# Xsuite benchmarks and code

This project has been developed as part of the GSI-FAIR summer student program 2022. 
It consists of a simulation for the sis100 accelerator based on the Xsuite library as well as two comparative tests:

- Comparison of space charge nodes

- Comparison of the tracking of both codes

The simulation is available both in jupyter notebook and in python file.
